# Solar-Panel-Efficiency-Predictor-and-detector
In this project, a machine learning model is created and it accurately measures the efficiency of solar panel based on the various environmental conditions. 
It will help companies to identify the area in advance where panel efficiency is good, thus will eventually benefit the business.
It also identifies the type and number of panels required to install based on the type of area.
